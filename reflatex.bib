abstract = {Bitcoin, a distributed, peer to peer crypto currency, has gained a significant popularity among different users around the world by promising users a fully decentralized network with an inherently independence from governments and without the influence of any central authorities and organizations. Mining is the fundamental concept in Bitcoin which must be done in checking all monetary transactions and verifying them which in return generates Bitcoin as a reward to encourage this work. While the qualitative nature of this unique system is clearly accepted and understood, there are some issues regarding to its decentralized network environment. Based on our analysis due to the high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous Bitcoin mining pools are increasing due to the fact that users together under a Bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the Bitcoin's blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. Furthermore, emerging huge mining farms with strong mining resources and fast processing power is another trend toward centralization. Although some might argue that, the protocol itself is purely decentralized and these are marketbased centralization, this trend clearly illustrates that the pure, decentralized protocol of Bitcoin is going toward centralization in its distributed network, where any kind of centralization should be considered carefully due to the 51{\%} attack. By analysing all the created blocks from 2009 to 2014 we proposed a centralization factor which shows how centralized is the state of Bitcoin's network in different years. Centralization, due its simplicity, is a phenomenon that happens to any disciplined and organized system automatically, which in case of Bitcoin is against the pure initial decentralized nature of it and might arise some concerns and threats to the Bitcoin's unforeseeable future.},

abstract = {—A Blockchain is basically a decentralized, dis-tributed ledger of all the transactions or events which takes place only after involving multiple parties. It ensures high level of security as the transactions which takes place are entirely anonymous. Each transactions or digital events taking place in a Blockchain network is verified, only if it is agreed upon by the consensus of the majority party of the users participating in this process. Blockchain is one of the emerging technologies in today's world and a lot of revolution and research has just began regarding this distributed technology. Bitcoin has been the most popular cryptographic currency since it was invented and it is the best example that uses the Blockchain technology. In this paper, we will discuss about the research being done on this new domain of Computer Science. We will outline the underlining concepts about this new technology. We will try to peek a bit into its applications in the financial and non financial sector. It is not only the most popular topic to discuss about, but is the most technological breakthrough, that is all set to revolutionize the entire world.},

The . Abstract — There is no doubt that the revolutionary concept of the blockchain , which is the underlying technology behind the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin and its successors , is triggering the start of a new era in the Internet and the online services . While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies ; in fact , many administrative operations , fintech procedures , and everyday services that can only be done offline and / or in person , can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services . What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts , as in the Ethereum platform . Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes , to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates . E - voting on the other hand , is another trending , yet critical , topic related to the online services . The blockchain with the smart contracts , emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer , cheaper , more secure , more transparent , and easier - to - use e - voting systems . Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable ones , due to its consistency , widespread use , and provision of smart contracts logic . An e - voting system must be secure , as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent , while protecting the privacy of the attendees . In this work , we have implemented and tested a sample e - voting application as a smart contract for the Ethereum network using the Ethereum wallets and the Solidity language . Android platform is also considered to allow voting for people who do not have an Ethereum wallet . After an election is held , eventually , the Ethereum blockchain will hold the records of ballots and votes . Users can submit their votes via an Android device or directly from their Ethereum wallets , and these transaction requests are handled with the consensus of every single Ethereum node . This consensus creates a transparent environment for e - voting . In addition to a broad discussion about reliability and efficiency of the blockchain - based e - voting systems , our application and its test results are presented in this paper , too .},

Bitcoin is the first attempt at creating a decentralized virtual currency with no central bank or financial entity controlling it and is very attractive to different demographies of users. A lot of misunderstanding and doubt surrounds Bitcoin. Based on studying the few years of Bitcoin's circulation and usage, we presented the strengths and weaknesses of Bitcoin and analyzed what opportunities and threats it faces in the current financial environment. We summarized the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for Bitcoin in an SWOT analysis. We concluded that the most important factors to influence the future of Bitcoin circulation and price are technological advances and people's openness to Bitcoin, the intervention of governments and financial powers by creating laws around cryptocurrencies and external events that are closely tied to the Bitcoin community.},

abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
